Hi, I am Jiancheng Pan (潘建成), a Research Intern at Interactive Intelligence Lab, Ant Research. I am a preparatory Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University in 2026.
Before that, I received Master's degree under the supervision of Prof. Cong Bai from Zhejiang University of Technology. I spent two years at Tsinghua University as a Visiting Research Student under the supervision of Prof. Xiaomeng Huang. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I was a Visiting Researcher at INSAIT, Sofia University working with Prof. Luc Van Gool and Dr. Danda Paudel.

🔬 I am interested in cutting-edge Visual Intelligence, focusing on Multimodal Learning, Foundation Models and MLLMs, Data-centric AI, and their applications across, e.g., Egocentric Vision, Earth Observation, and AI for Sustainability.
